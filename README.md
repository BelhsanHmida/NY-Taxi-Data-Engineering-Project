# Uber Data Engineering Project

This project involves processing and analyzing Uber data using Google Cloud services including Compute Engine (VMs), BigQuery, and Looker to create a dashboard for visualization.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end data engineering pipeline using Google Cloud technologies for handling Uber data and visualizing insights through a dashboard.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):**
  - Compute Engine (VMs) for running data processing tasks.
  - BigQuery for storing and querying large datasets.
  - Looker for building interactive dashboards.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

- **ETL Pipeline:**
  - Python scripts for extracting, transforming, and loading Uber data into BigQuery.

- **Data Analysis and Modeling:**
  - Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data modeling using Lucid.

- **Dashboard Creation:**
  - Utilization of Looker to design and implement a dashboard for visualizing analytical insights.
