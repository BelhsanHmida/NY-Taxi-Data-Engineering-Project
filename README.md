The project is organized into the following components:

- **ETL Pipeline:**
  - Python scripts for extracting, transforming, and loading Uber data into BigQuery.

- **Data Analysis and Modeling:**
  - Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data modeling using Lucid.

- **Dashboard Creation:**
  - Utilization of Looker to design and implement a dashboard for visualizing analytical insights.
## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):**
  - Google Storag   
  - Compute Engine (VMs) for running data processing tasks.
  - BigQuery for storing and querying large datasets.
  - Looker Studio for building interactive dashboards.

- **Modern Data Pipeine Tool** - https://www.mage.ai/

 ## Dataset Used

- The TLC trip record data for yellow and green taxis contains information such as the pick-up and drop-off times and locations, the distances traveled during the trips, itemized fare      details, rate categories, payment methods, and the number of passengers reported by the driver.
- Data dictionary : https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf
